  Automatic Watering Plant System

  Create an automatic watering plant system that will run a small 3V DC water pump to water a plant into a vase if the Soil Moisture Sensor into the vase reads a value higher than the optimal value of moisture for that plant, meaning that the soil is dry.
  If the moisture level reads by the sensor is higher than the optimal value of moisture for the plant, a red LED will turn on, and a message "Dry Soil :(" will appear on the LCD Screen, together with the water pump being turned on, if not, a green LED will turn on and a message "Happy Plant :)" will appear on the LCD Screen.
  The water compartment also has a Water Level Sensor with three different sizes of pins, which read three different values. If the sensor reads that the three pins are in contact with water a green LED will turn on, and a message "Waterlevel: Full" will appear on the LCD Screen. If the sensor reads that two pins are in contact with water, a yellow LED will turn on, and a message "WaterLevel: Half" will appear on the LCD Screen. If the sensor reads that only one pin is in contact with water, a red LED will turn on, and a message "WaterLevel: Empty" will appear on the LCD Screen.
  Also a condition was created that if the Soil Moisture Sensor reads a value higher than the optimal value of moisture for the plant, AND the Water Level Sensor reads that only one pin is in contact with water, the pump will not be turned on.
  Display the read values and the desirable information on the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE.
