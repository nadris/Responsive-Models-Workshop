  Random Drawing Machine

  Create drawings by the use of a Sharpie pen, attached to the end of two lasercut acrylic arms, attached to two parallel circles, connected to two 12V DC Motors.
  The speed of those two motors are related to the values read by two Infrared Distance Sensor (IRDS), turning the DC Motor faster if the distance sensor reads a higher value (closer object). Since the sensors are attached distant from each other, the values that one sensor reads is different from the other, moving the DC Motors at an erratic and unexpected time and speed, creating a random drawing from the attached Sharpie pen.
  Display the read values and the remapped speed values on the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE.
