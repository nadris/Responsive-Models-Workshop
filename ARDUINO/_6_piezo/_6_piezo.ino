  Piezo Buzzer

  Play a Piezo buzzer, changing the pitch of the notes according to the values read by a photoresistor.
  Display the read values from the sensor and the pitch values on the Serial Monitor.

  Input:
  1x Photo cell (CdS photoresistor)
  1x 1 KÎ© resistor
  Output:
  1x Piezo Buzzer - PS1240
