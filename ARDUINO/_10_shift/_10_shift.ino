/*
  Shift Register

  Control with a Shift Register (74HC595 Serial to Parallel Converter) up to eight LEDs with a predetermined pattern using only three pins of the Arduino.

  Output:
  1x 74HC595 Shift Register
  8x 5mm LED
  8x 220Î© resistor

void updateShiftRegister()
{
  digitalWrite(latchPin, LOW); //the function 'updateShiftRegister' sets the latchPin to low
  shiftOut(dataPin, clockPin, LSBFIRST, leds); //then calls the function 'shiftOut' that takes four parameters, the first two are the pins to use for Data and Clock respectively.The third parameter specifies which end of the data to start at. It is going to start with the right most bit, which is referred to as the 'Least Significant Bit' (LSB). The last parameter is the actual data to be shifted into the shift register, which in this case is 'leds'
  digitalWrite(latchPin, HIGH); //the function sets the latchPin back to high
